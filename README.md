# UniHub---Hackathon-Project
UniHub is a web-based platform designed to solve the problem of student disconnection and fragmented campus information. Developed as a hackathon project, UniHub's core mission is to create a centralized "single point of truth" for all university events, announcements, and club activities, fostering a more engaged and cohesive campus community.
