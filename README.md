### UniHub: Reconnecting Campus Life

UniHub is a web-based platform designed to solve the problem of student disconnection and fragmented campus information. Developed as a hackathon project, UniHub's core mission is to create a centralized "single point of truth" for all university events, announcements, and club activities, fostering a more engaged and cohesive campus community.

This project represents a rapid prototype of our solution, showcasing key features and a clear vision for future development.

#### Key Features

  * **Centralized Information Feed:** A unified dashboard for students to discover all campus events and announcements in one place.
  * **Effortless Event Discovery:** Intuitive search and filtering tools to help students find opportunities that matter to them.
  * **Community Connection:** A platform for clubs and departments to directly publish and manage their content, reaching a wider audience.
  * **Monetization Strategy:** The infographic includes a clear plan for future revenue generation through premium listings, event ticketing, and local sponsorships.

#### Hackathon Status

This repository contains the source code for our hackathon submission. The project was developed over a short period with a focus on demonstrating a functional proof-of-concept and a clear market strategy. It is not yet a production-ready application.

#### Technologies Used

  * **HTML:** For the document structure.
  * **Tailwind CSS:** For a modern and responsive design.
